# --- Scoring Configuration ---
# This section defines how to score engagement opportunities (e.g., tweets).
# The score is a weighted sum of several factors.

opportunity_scoring:
  # Weights for the primary engagement metrics.
  # These are normalized, so their sum doesn't have to be 1.
  metric_weights:
    likes: 0.2
    replies: 0.5
    retweets: 0.3
    views: 0.1 # Added views to consider reach

  # Time decay factor. Newer tweets are more valuable.
  # Score is multiplied by exp(-decay_rate * age_in_hours).
  # A higher value means a steeper drop-off in score over time.
  time_decay:
    decay_rate: 0.1 # e.g., a 24-hour-old tweet's score is multiplied by exp(-0.1*24) ~= 0.09

  # Author-based scoring modifiers.
  # These are multipliers applied to the score based on the author's profile.
  author_modifiers:
    # Multiplier for tweets from influencers listed above.
    is_influencer_multiplier: 1.5
    # Bonus for authors with a high follower count.
    # The bonus is calculated as: 1 + (followers_bonus * log10(followers/1000)).
    # This gives diminishing returns for very high follower counts.
    followers_bonus:
      factor: 0.1
      min_followers_for_bonus: 1000
    # Bonus for authors with a good follower-to-following ratio.
    # The bonus is calculated as: 1 + (ratio_bonus * min(5, ratio)).
    follower_ratio_bonus:
      factor: 0.05
      min_ratio_for_bonus: 2.0

  # Content-based scoring modifiers.
  # These adjust the score based on the tweet's content.
  content_modifiers:
    # Multiplier for tweets that ask a question, as they are more likely to
    # invite a reply.
    contains_question_multiplier: 1.3
    # Multiplier for tweets containing media (images/videos).
    contains_media_multiplier: 1.1
    # Penalty for tweets that contain external links, which can sometimes
    # be less conversational.
    contains_link_penalty: 0.8
    # Ideal length range for a tweet to be considered for engagement.
    # A small bonus is applied if the tweet is within this range.
    ideal_length_range:
      min: 50
      max: 200
      bonus: 1.1

# Thresholds for different recommendation priorities.
# The final score is compared against these thresholds to categorize recommendations.
priority_thresholds:
  strategic: 0.8 # e.g., ENGAGE_WITH_INFLUENCER
  growth: 0.6      # e.g., REPLY_TO_HIGH_ENGAGEMENT_TWEET
